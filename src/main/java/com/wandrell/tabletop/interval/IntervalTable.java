/**
 * Represents a table where sections of an interval are mapped to different
 * values. Meaning that the main interval is divided into a series of smaller
 * ones, each of them having some sort of value assigned.
 * <p>
 * Commonly, all the intervals, both the main and the contained ones, are
 * integer intervals and, obviously, the contained intervals are contained in
 * the main one, are consecutive one to another and create the main one when
 * joined. Still, it is also possible that the contained intervals would
 * overlap, or leave gaps, but this is not common.
 * <p>
 * Apart from this there are no other constraints, allowing negative values or
 * not proper intervals to be used.
 * <p>
 * Each of the contained intervals is mapped to a value whose type can not be
 * predicted, it can range items of any kind such as weapons or armor, to more
 * abstract concepts like deployment zones or in-game events.
 * <p>
 * For example, this is Bloodbowl's weather table:
 * <table summary="Interval table example">
 * <tr>
 * <th>Interval</th>
 * <th>Result</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2</td>
 * <td>Sweltering Heat</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>3</td>
 * <td>Very Sunny</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>4-10</td>
 * <td>Nice</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>11</td>
 * <td>Pouring Rain</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>12</td>
 * <td>Blizzard</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * In this case, two dice of six sides are rolled, and the result is compared to
 * the first column. Then the event on the second column is applied to the game.
 * <p>
 * This represents a common use, as interval tables are commonly used to
 * generate non-numeric random values with the use or dice.
