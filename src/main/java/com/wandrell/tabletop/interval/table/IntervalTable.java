/**
 * Interface for representing an intervals table. This is a table composed of
 * consecutive intervals, each of them having a value assigned to it. Another
 * way to see it is as an interval divided into several smaller intervals, each
 * with a value assigned to it.
 * <p>
 * All the intervals are made of integers, but apart from this there are no
 * other constraints, allowing negative values or not proper intervals to be
 * used.
 * <p>
 * Each of the contained intervals is mapped to a value whose type can not be
 * predicted. Some common values are score points or items such as weapons or
 * armor, but may include more abstract concepts like deployment zones or
 * in-game events.
 * <p>
 * For example, this is Bloodbowl's weather table:
 * <table summary="Interval table example">
 * <tr>
 * <th>Interval</th>
 * <th>Result</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2</td>
 * <td>Sweltering Heat</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>3</td>
 * <td>Very Sunny</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>4-10</td>
 * <td>Nice</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>11</td>
 * <td>Pouring Rain</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>12</td>
 * <td>Blizzard</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * This table is used by rolling two dice of six sides, adding the values, and
 * comparing the result to the first column. Then the event on the second column
 * is applied to the game.
 * 
 * @author Bernardo Mart√≠nez Garrido
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of the values assigned to the intervals
