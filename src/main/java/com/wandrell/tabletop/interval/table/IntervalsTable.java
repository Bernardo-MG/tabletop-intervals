/**
 * Interface for representing an intervals table. This is a table composed of
 * consecutive intervals, each of them having a value assigned to it. Another
 * way to see it is as an interval divided into several smaller intervals, each
 * with a value assigned to it.
 * <p>
 * Each of the contained intervals is mapped to a value, which can be anything.
 * Some common values are score points or items such as weapons or armor, but
 * may include more abstract concepts like deployment zones or in-game events.
 * <p>
 * For example, this is Bloodbowl's weather table:
 * <table summary="Interval table example">
 * <tr>
 * <th>Interval</th>
 * <th>Result</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2</td>
 * <td>Sweltering Heat</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>3</td>
 * <td>Very Sunny</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>4-10</td>
 * <td>Nice</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>11</td>
 * <td>Pouring Rain</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>12</td>
 * <td>Blizzard</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * Here weather events are mapped to the different intervals, some of them being
 * not proper intervals.
 * <p>
 * To use this table two dice of six sides are rolled, and the result is
 * compared to the first column. Then the weather event on the second column is
 * applied to the game.
 * 
 * @author Bernardo Mart√≠nez Garrido
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of the values assigned to the intervals
